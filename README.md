The instances of both example and synthetic, as well as real instances, are located in the `/instances` folder.

The prompts used for each instance are located in the `/prompts` folder, without the alpha and beta values. 

In the `/results-empirical-evaluation` folder, you will find the results of each LLM. The `.response` files contain the results with their respective alpha and beta values, and the `.prob` files contain the probabilities for each instance. Additionally, the probabilities of irace for the four real instances are included.
